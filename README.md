# Covid-Database


Reads a CSV from CDC's COVID Data Tracker and populates a database. Methods include retrieving total deaths, peak deaths, searching peak daily deaths by state, and a method that compares daily infections to a set number, and if it is less than that number, returns that it is safe to open.
